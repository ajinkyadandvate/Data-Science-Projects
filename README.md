This Repository contains my projects on data analysis , machine learning and deep learning on data sets provided by different data sources.

Majority of the data used was collected from FiveThirtyEight github repo and rest were collected from similar online sources.

Tools used for analysis -
All the analysis is done on jupyter(ipython) which internally uses pandas, numpy, matplotlib ,scipy tools and sklearn models.
